# checkers-client-server
I created checkers game in java based on client-server model with communicator.

# How it works?:
There are two projects in repository for the server and for the client.
Server is set up on localhost: 127.0.0.1 and its searching for 2 clients after running.
When the server will find two clients connected, it starting a game, but you need to run client projects.
You can communicate with your second client project (player) via basic communicator.
The game is started by the player with white pawns.

# How to set up projects?:
1. You need to download repository (server and client projects) to your local machine.
2. Copy the client project to achieve second client project.
3. Run the server and wait for searching state in a console.
4. Do the same with two clients projects, just run them.
5. After starting the clients, they will be automatically connected to the server and the game will begin.
